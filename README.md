	The MBTA has been running for quite a while, serving the citizens of the inner and greater boston area. From students, to elders, nurses, doctors, there is no doubt that the positive impact it has made is life changing. It is cheap, convenient, reaches most major hotspots, and time friendly. With that being said, all these developments in technology that are being observed, one can’t help but think: How can we apply these advancements to help make it more efficient, and reach full functionality without inflicting too much change that disrupts the mundane activities of the MBTA’s users. One of the most effective methods is observing data channels such as hotspots, crowded stations, hours of the day, days of the week, and accordingly adjust timetables and/or routes to make sure that there is almost no “waste” of any sort. Be it time, space, or energy, there are a lot of factors that go into making that decision. Essentially we will be conducting a data study where we hope to identify key elements that can create a new way of living for commuting Bostonians and add a component of ease in their lives.
